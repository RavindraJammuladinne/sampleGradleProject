- Run gradle init at parent level
- define all common configurations in parent build and settings files
- If you have modules repeat gradle init cmd and generate build and setting files and then modify accordingly.
- If you are using ant+ivy then convert all ivy dependences by executing this task

build.gradle:

	task convertIvyDeps << {
    def ivyXml = new XmlParser().parse(new File("ivy.xml"))

    println "dependencies {"
    ivyXml.dependencies.dependency.each {
        def scope = it.@conf?.contains("test") ? "testCompile" : "compile"
        println("\t$scope \"${it.@org}:${it.@name}:${it.@rev}\"")
    }
    println "}"
}

run : gradle convertIvyDeps

the above cmd will generate all dependences that has been defined in ivy file.

- copy all dependencies section and paste in build.gradle file

- Modify the version as per requirements (make sure the repositories section should be defined with your remote repo URL's)

- Try to execute by running gradle build
